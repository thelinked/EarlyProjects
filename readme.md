About
-------
We all have to start learning somewhere. These projects were my first substantial programming projects. They are both written in C++ and use SDL. Everything here can be considered to be under the Apache License Version 2.0.


Building
---------
Code::Blocks project files are included, other than that your on your own. If it helps, these were developed in Code::Blocks with mingw on windows.
